1]	This 
	This is a keyword ,is used to differentiate between instance variable and parameters.
	Only one class is required to use this  keyword.
	This keyword always pointing towards instance variables.
	
	Super
	Super is a keyword,is used to invoke base class method in derived class method.
	Two classes are mandatory to use super keyword.
	super keywordalways pointing towards base class only.
	
	This()
	only one class is required to call this method.
	It should be the first statement of constructor.
	
	
	Super()
	It is method used to call base class constructor in derived class.
	It should be the first statement of the constructor.
	Two classes are mandatory to call super method.
	
	SCP : String Constant pool 
	
	SCP is present in heap area.
	SCP is a memory where the String variables and string objects created with help of litterals are stored.
	
2]	Object oriented programming is a way to develop a software.
	Java is object oriented programming language.
	Java consider the everything as an object because of this java is a OOP.
	
	There are 4 elements in oops 
	Inheritance : is process of acquire property from base class to derived class using extends keyword.
	Polymorphism : Object behaving differently at instance of time.
	Encapsulation : Grouping data into a single  unit to make data secured using private keyword .
	
3] Extends keyword used in inheritance while implements used in abstraction.
	Two classes are mandatory to extend while implements required one interface and one class.
	
6] Polymorphism
	Object behaving differently at instance of time is known as polymorphism.
	Here reference is of base class and object creation is of derived class.
	There are two types 
		Compiletime polymorphism : if the method invoke is decided at compiletime That process is compile time polymorphism.
									It is also known as static polymorphism.We can do method overloading to achive static polymorphism.
		Run time polymorphism :if the method invoke is decided at runtime That process is runtime polymorphism.
									It is also known as dynamic polymorphism.We can do method over riding to achive dynamic polymorphism.
	
9]	Class : 
	class is a keyword used to create a class.
	Class is a blue print to develop a software.
	class is a logical entity.
	Class consist of states,behaviours and objects.
	Classname always start with upper case.
	
	Object :
	object is instance of class.
	object is real world entity.
	Object will be created when instance members are present in class.
	we can create object using new keyword.

	
10] No memory will occupied by class.

11] Types of constructor 
		Default constructor : constructor without any parameters.
		Parameterised constructor : constructor with parameters.
		
12] No 

13] abstraction : displays only relevant attributes of objects and hide irrelevant attributes.
	We can achive abstraction using implements keyword.
	one class and one interface is mandatory to achive abstraction.
	
	 example :
	  Shopping complexes are made for shops while building but after that implements were done 

14] compiletime polymorphism is done at compiletime while runtime polymorphism done at runtime.
	compiletime polymorphism is achived by method overloading while runtime polymorphism is achived by method overiding.
	parameters will differs while parameter should	be same.
